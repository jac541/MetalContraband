# Metal Contraband

A blog-style website based around upcoming and established metal acts. 

## Description

This project is built primarily in HTML utilizing Bootstrap as a pseudo-framework. CSS and JavaScript are also implemented for some UI elements and quality-of-life.


### Dependencies

* Most of the HTML pages can be opened directly with a browser. However, to run this site's Top 10 lists locally, you will require some kind of PHP server - I personally tested it using an XAMPP stack.

### Installing

Extract the program using the exact file structure, and place it in the public-facing folder for your server.
